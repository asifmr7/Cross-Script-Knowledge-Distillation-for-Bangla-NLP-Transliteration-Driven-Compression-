# Task-Specific Cross-Lingual Transferability into Bangla: A Multi-Source and Dialect-Aware Study

Repo goal. This repository contains code, configs, and results for a comprehensive study of cross-lingual transfer (EN→HI→UR→BN) across three core Bangla NLP tasks — POS Tagging, Dependency Parsing, and Sentence Classification — plus script-aware Knowledge Distillation (KD) from XLM-R → RoBERTa using transliteration and shared-tokenizer strategies.Placeholder main branch

This branch is intentionally minimal; code lives on feature branches.
